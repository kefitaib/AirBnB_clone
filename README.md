# AirBnB_clone
##Description:
AirBnB_clone is a project emulating the airbnb website it's still at the early stages of developement as it only implements the back end console and the models/classes to be stored later on on a database and represented on a front end interface, 
at its last stage it's expected to be a complete web application that clones the airbnb website
